# Multimodal Independent Components

This folder contains the independent components (ICs) obtained after ICA of multimodal brain signals using **PET** and **Functional Network Connectivity (FNC)** data.  

Each IC is represented by a pair of files:  
- `IC_001_PET.nii`: PET component of the 1st IC (nifti file)
- `IC_001_FNC.png`: Corresponding FNC component of the 1st IC  

Similarly, `IC_002_PET.nii` and `IC_002_FNC.png` represent the PET and FNC parts of the 2nd IC, and so on.
